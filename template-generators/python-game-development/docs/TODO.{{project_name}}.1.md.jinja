# {{project_name}} - Sprint 1: Core Game Logic & Engine

## Sprint Overview
**Duration:** {{sprint_duration_weeks}} weeks  
**Focus:** Implement core game mechanics, logic, and engine foundation

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goals
- [ ] Implement core game rules and logic
- [ ] Create game state management system
- [ ] Build basic game engine architecture
- [ ] Establish game loop foundation

## ðŸ“‹ Core Development Tasks

### Game Logic Implementation
- [ ] Define game rules in {{game_framework}} compatible module
- [ ] Implement board/game state representation (immutable where practical)
- [ ] Create player management system
- [ ] Implement win/lose/draw condition detection
- [ ] Add turn-based game flow logic

### Game Engine Architecture
- [ ] Create main GameEngine class with clean interfaces
- [ ] Implement game loop infrastructure (update/render cycle)
- [ ] Add game state management (menu, playing, paused, game over)
- [ ] Create event handling system for user input
- [ ] Implement basic rendering foundation

### Data Models & Validation
- [ ] Create Pydantic models for game entities
- [ ] Implement game configuration management
- [ ] Add data validation for game moves/actions
- [ ] Create serialization for save/load functionality

### Core Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all game logic functions
- [ ] Test game state transitions comprehensively  
- [ ] Validate win condition detection accuracy
- [ ] Performance tests for core game operations

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy
- [ ] Property-based testing for game rules (hypothesis)
- [ ] Edge case testing (invalid moves, boundary conditions)
- [ ] Game simulation testing (full game playthrough)
- [ ] Regression testing for rule changes

## âœ… Definition of Done
- [ ] All core game logic implemented and tested
- [ ] Game engine can run basic game loop
- [ ] Win/lose conditions work correctly
- [ ] Code coverage >90% for core logic
- [ ] Ready for UI development in Sprint 2
