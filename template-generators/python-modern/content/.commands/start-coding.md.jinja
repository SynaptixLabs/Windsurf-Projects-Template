# {{ project_slug }} - Start Coding Script

## 🚀 Project Initialization & Development Continuation

**Purpose**: Initialize the project for development and help resume work based on current state.

---

## 📋 Initialization Process

### Step 1: Project State Assessment
```bash
if [ -f "state.md" ]; then
    echo "🔄 Existing project detected – resuming from current state"
else
    echo "🆕 New project initialization starting"
    # Create initial state.md (already generated by template)
fi
```

### Step 2: Documentation & Structure Review
1. Read `state.md` and confirm Sprint 0 status.
2. Open `docs/sprint.{{ project_slug }}.0.md` and follow the tasks sequentially.

### Step 3: Run Quality Gates & App
```bash
poetry install        # Install dependencies
poetry run lint       # Ruff + formatting check
poetry run test       # Run pytest suite
poetry run ci         # Run full local CI (lint, type, tests)
```

**Next Steps**: After completing Sprint 0 tasks, update `state.md` to move to Sprint 1 and generate new sprint TODO lists using Windsurf generator if needed.
