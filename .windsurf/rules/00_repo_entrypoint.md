# Repo entrypoint (thin)

If unsure where to start:
1) Read `.windsurf/rules/00_synaptix_ops.md` (always-on repo operating rules)
2) Read `AGENTS.md` in the nearest directory scope (auto-applied by the editor)
3) Read `/docs/00_INDEX.md` and follow the links

For role-based work:
- apply the CTO/CPO role-instance rules as needed.
